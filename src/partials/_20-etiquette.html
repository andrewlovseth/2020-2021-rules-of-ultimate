    <li><a id="20.A"></a>If an infraction is committed and not called, the player committing the infraction should inform the infracted player or team of the infraction.
    <li><a id="20.B"></a>It is the responsibility of all players to avoid any delay when starting, restarting, or continuing play. This includes standing over the disc or taking more time than reasonably necessary to put the disc into play. <span class="annotation">[[This includes standing back from the disc, wandering around to gain more time, etc. Pretending not to delay while delaying is still delaying.]]</span>
    <li><a id="20.C"></a>On a <span class="tooltip" title="Any halting of play due to a call, discussion, or timeout that requires a check or self-check to restart play. The term play stops means a stoppage of play occurs.">stoppage of play</span>, if it is ever unclear which of a team's members are the current players or where they are on or off the field, they should identify themselves when the opposing team requests.
    <li><a id="20.D"></a>If a dispute arises on the field, play stops and is restarted with a check when the matter is resolved.
    <li><a id="20.E"></a>If a novice player commits an infraction out of sincere ignorance of the rules, it should be common practice to stop play and explain the infraction.
    <li><a id="20.F"></a>When a call is made, throwers must stop play by visibly or audibly communicating the stoppage as soon as they are aware of the call and all players should echo calls on the field. <span class="annotation">[[If the <span class="tooltip" title="The defensive player within ten feet of the thrower's pivot or of the thrower if no pivot has been established.

    <li><a id="20.G"></a>In addition to the assumption that players will not intentionally violate the rules, players are similarly expected to make every effort to avoid violating them.
