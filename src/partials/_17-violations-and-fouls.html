<li><a id="17"></a>Violations and Fouls
<ol>
    <li><a id="17.A"></a>An infraction may only be called by a player on the infracted team who recognizes that it has occurred, unless specified differently elsewhere. <span class="annotation">[[The player must know that a specific rule was violated and have perceived the particular action with certainty. A player may not call an infraction whenever the player maybe recognizes that some infraction might have occurred.]]</span> The player must immediately call "violation" or the name of the specific infraction loudly.
    <li><a id="17.B"></a>A player called for an infraction may contest that call if that player believes the infraction did not occur. <span class="annotation">[[This belief may be based on the player's perspective on the particular sequence of events or based on a disagreement over the application of the rules, provided the player has read and understands the rules. For example, "No, I didn't slap your hand" or "Tipping the disc to someone else is not a travel."]]</span>
    <li><a id="17.C"></a>Any time an infraction is called, the Continuation Rule applies. Continuation Rule: Play stops when the thrower in possession acknowledges that an infraction has been called. <span class="annotation">[[This refers to the thrower who possesses the disc or has just released the disc at the time of the infraction/call. Who the thrower (<a href="#3.O.5">3.O.5</a>) is is determined at the time of the infraction/call.]]</span> If a call is made when the disc is in the air or the thrower is in the act of throwing, or if the thrower fails to acknowledge the call and subsequently attempts a pass, play continues until the outcome of that pass is determined. For the purpose of the Continuation Rule, an uncontested stall that occurs after another call is treated the same as an incomplete pass. <span class="annotation">[[Thus, if you get stalled before you acknowledge a call, it is treated the same as if you ignored the call and threw a turnover.]]</span> Play then either stops or continues according to the following:
    <ol>
        <li><a id="17.C.1"></a>Despite any outcome dictated by these rules, if the involved players on both teams agree that the infraction did not affect the outcome of the play, play stops and the result of the play stands. This provision does not apply if the thrower is aware an infraction has been called and subsequently attempts a pass.
        <li><a id="17.C.2"></a>Where the outcome of these rules is for play to continue unhalted, the player who called the infraction must announce "play on." Additionally, any player recognizing that play should continue without stoppage should announce "play on." If the player who called the infraction does not announce "play on" and the opposing team is uncertain whether play should continue, the opposing team has the option to stop play by calling "violation." 
        <li><a id="17.C.3"></a>For calls made by the offense:
        <ol>
            <li><a id="17.C.3.a"></a>If the pass is complete:
            <ol>
                <li><a id="17.C.3.a.1"></a>If the offense called the infraction before the thrower began the act of throwing (<a href="#3.O.3">3.O.3</a>), play stops and possession reverts to the thrower. 
                <li><a id="17.C.3.a.2"></a>If the offense called the infraction after the thrower began the act of throwing, play continues unhalted. 
                <li><a id="17.C.3.a.3"></a>Where an infraction is called by the thrower, players should treat the call as if it was made when the infraction occurred in determining whether the call was made before or after the thrower was in the act of throwing. If the infraction occurred after the throw was released, the call is considered to have been made by a non-thrower. <span class="annotation">[[This means that if you throw a turnover and call a foul on contact after the release, the turnover will generally stand. Note that the timing is based on when the infraction occurred for this rule.]]</span>

                <li><a id="17.C.3.b.3"></a>Where the thrower calls an infraction which occurred before the thrower began the act of throwing, play continues unhalted and the result of the play stands.

            <li><a id="17.C.4.b"></a>If the pass is incomplete, play continues un-halted. 
        </ol>
        <li><a id="17.C.5"></a>An infraction affected the play if an infracted player determines that the outcome of the specific play, from the time of the infraction until play stops, may have been meaningfully different absent the infraction. <span class="annotation">[[It is the infracted player's responsibility to announce if play was affected. For example, if a defender calls "pick" while trailing a receiver by 6 feet, the defender should indicate whether the pick affected the play.

If the pick did affect the play, the disc reverts to the thrower.]]</span> For example, if a receiver is fouled and thereby prevented from getting open for a pass, the play was affected; however, if the receiver would not have received a pass even without the foul, the play was not affected. <span class="annotation">[[Contact that occurs after the outcome of the play is determined cannot affect the play.

    <li><a id="17.D"></a>If a player makes a play-halting call and subsequently determines that their call was incorrect, they should retract the call by announcing "retracted." Play still stops. Play restarts with a check and the stall resumes according to <a href="#15.A.5.a">15.A.5.a</a>.
    <li><a id="17.E"></a>If a dispute arises concerning an infraction or the outcome of a play (e.g., a catch where no one had a good perspective), and the teams cannot come to a satisfactory resolution, play stops, and the disc is returned to the thrower and put into play with a check (<a href="#9.D">9.D</a>), with the count reached plus one or at six if over five.
    <li><a id="17.F"></a>Any player may stop a rolling or sliding disc, but advancing it in any direction is a violation.

        <li><a id="17.H.2"></a>Offsetting infractions: If both offensive and defensive infractions occur simultaneously or the sequence cannot be determined, the resolution for this set of infractions is: the disc is returned to the thrower and put into play with a check, with the count reached plus one or at six if over five. <span class="annotation">[[It is possible that resolutions to earlier infractions may ultimately change this particular outcome.]]</span>

        <li><a id="17.I.1"></a>Dangerous Play. Actions demonstrating reckless disregard for the safety of or posing a significant risk of injury to fellow players, or other dangerously aggressive behavior are considered "dangerous play" and are treated as a <span class="tooltip" title="Non-Incidental contact: contact between opposing players (see 3.F for a definition of incidental contact).

            <ul>
                <li>significantly colliding with a mostly stationary opponent,

            <ol>
                <li><a id="17.I.1.a"></a>Dangerous play is considered a foul regardless of whether or when the disc arrives or contact occurs.
                <ol>
                    <li><a id="17.I.1.a.1"></a>The vast majority of dangerous play will involve contact between players. However, contact is not required for a player to invoke this rule where there is reasonable certainty that contact would have occurred had the player not taken steps to avoid contact. <span class="annotation">[[A player is not required to hold their position and receive contact in order to call "dangerous play," but the mere possibility of contact is insufficient to justify a call. Furthermore, if the offending player stops or changes their path such that contact would not have occurred, contact was not "reasonably certain."]]</span>
                </ol>
                <li><a id="17.I.1.b"></a>Resolution. If uncontested, a call of "dangerous play" is resolved as an analogous foul (e.g., if the call occurred while or immediately after the calling player was making a play on a disc in the air, it is treated as a Receiving Foul (<a href="#17.I.4.b">17.I.4.b</a>)). A player called for dangerous play may contest the call if they believe the call was incorrect (<a href="#17.B">17.B</a>).

                    <li><a id="17.I.1.b.2"></a>Dangerous play occurring when or immediately after the disc is in the air is treated as a receiving foul if either player involved is attempting a play on the disc. However, the calling player may elect to treat the dangerous play as a general foul, if the player determines that the dangerous play was unrelated to the overall play that decided the outcome of the action. <span class="annotation">[[For example, if a third player appears and grabs the disc far before it reaches the two involved players, or if the disc is thrown to the opposite side of the field, the involved players will not be attempting a play on the disc. However, if multiple players accumulate under a floating disc, one player's dangerous play will be treated as a receiving foul, even if a third player happens to make a successful play on the disc, as the players under the disc were attempting a play on the disc. The calling player would have discretion to deem the third player's play so independent and removed from the involved players that the calling player wishes to treat the dangerous play as a general foul rather than a receiving foul. In general, a calling player's decision that a dangerous play was unrelated to the overall play will be based on the dangerous play being removed in significant distance or time from the overall play. By way of further example, even a dangerous play committed against a player unaware of the approaching disc will be treated as a receiving foul, where the offending player was attempting to make a play on the disc, giving the benefit of the doubt that the calling player could potentially have become aware of the approaching disc, had the offending player made a safe play. In this instance, the calling player could determine that it would not have been possible to become aware of the disc such that the outcome of the play would have changed and therefore elect to treat the dangerous play as a general foul.]]</span>

In this situation, the calling player determines whether the play was affected, under the standard enunciated in this rule and its annotations. <span class="annotation">[[A disc is obviously uncatchable only when it hits the ground before a catch could possibly be made, is out-of-bounds with no possibility of an in-bounds completion, or otherwise presents no opportunity for a catch (whether initial or subsequent efforts), giving every benefit of the doubt to the calling player.]]</span> <span class="annotation">[[In determining whether a dangerous play affected the play under <a href="#17.I.1.b.3">17.I.1.b.3</a>, the calling player should broadly consider the entire play, including any approach taken by the offending player immediately before the dangerous play. A good rule of thumb is to look to the last time when a player could have still changed their actions and actively avoided a dangerous outcome but did not (the "point of no return") through the time immediately after resolution of the play and broadly consider whether the outcome of the play could possibly have been different, had the offending player taken a safe approach.
