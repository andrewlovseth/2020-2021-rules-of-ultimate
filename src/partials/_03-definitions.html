<ol>
    <li><a id="3.A"></a>Best perspective: The most complete view available by a player that includes the relative positions of the disc, ground, players, and line markers involved in a play. On an unlined field, this may require sighting from one field marker to another. Best perspective always belongs to a player. However, players may rely on the following sources as a component of best perspective:
        <ol>
            <li><a id="3.A.1"></a>Players may seek the perspective of <span class="tooltip" title="Any team member who is present at the field and eligible to participate in the game, but who is not a player participating in the current point.">sideline players</span> to clarify the rules and to assist players in making the appropriate call. Players may seek the perspective of <span class="tooltip" title="A team member who has been officially recognized by event organizers to have met the requirements necessary for coaching, including but not limited to certification, screening, education, and registration. Coaches are permitted in areas where sideline players are allowed, during and between points, in accordance with event rules. Coaches are not permitted to make calls or contribute to the discussion or resolution of calls, except to clarify rules if requested.">coaches</span> to clarify a rule, but not to assist in making the appropriate call.
            <ol>
                <li><a id="3.A.1.a"></a><span class="tooltip" title="Any team member who is present at the field and eligible to participate in the game, but who is not a player participating in the current point.">Sideline players</span> should not offer their perspective unless solicited by a player. However, a <span class="tooltip" title="Any team member who is present at the field and eligible to participate in the game, but who is not a player participating in the current point.">sideline player</span> may offer perspective without being asked by a player if the perspective offered is to the detriment of the <span class="tooltip" title="Any team member who is present at the field and eligible to participate in the game, but who is not a player participating in the current point.">sideline player's</span> team.
            </ol>
            <li><a id="3.A.2"></a>Players may review officially-designated video footage to assist in resolving a call where such footage is available. However, play may not be delayed to review video footage. <span class="annotation">[[For example, live instant replay in a stadium setting may be used by players to resolve a contested foul call. Players may not, however, request that a particular play be replayed on the screen. If, after reviewing the video, players still cannot agree, they should not delay the game to rewatch the play multiple times; instead, the play should be treated as a regular contested foul.]]</span>
        </ol>
        If no player has sufficient perspective to make a call, the disc should revert to the thrower (in the case of in-bounds/out-of-bounds and up/down disputes) or remain with the receiver on the end zone line (in the case of goal/non-goal disputes).
    
    <li><a id="3.B"></a>Completed pass: Any catch that results in the team in possession of the disc retaining possession. Any pass that is not complete is incomplete.
    <li><a id="3.C"></a>Foul: Non-Incidental contact between opposing players (see <a href="#3.F">3.F</a> for a definition of incidental contact). In general, the player initiating the contact has committed the foul.
    <li><a id="3.D"></a>Ground contact: All player contact with the ground directly related to a specific event or maneuver (e.g., jumping, diving, leaning or falling), including landing or recovering after being off-balance. Items on the ground are considered part of the ground.
    <li><a id="3.E"></a>Guarding: A defender is guarding an <span class="tooltip" title="A player whose team is in possession of the disc.">offensive player</span> when they are within 10 feet of that offensive player and are reacting to that <span class="tooltip" title="A player whose team is in possession of the disc.">offensive player</span>. <span class="annotation">[[A defender who turns away from an <span class="tooltip" title="A player whose team is in possession of the disc.">offensive player</span> and begins focusing on and reacting to the thrower is no longer guarding that <span class="tooltip" title="A player whose team is in possession of the disc.">offensive player</span>.]]</span>
    <li><a id="3.F"></a>Incidental contact: Contact between opposing players that does not affect continued play. <span class="annotation">[[For example, contact affects continued play if the contact knocks a player off-balance and interferes with their ability to continue cutting or playing defense.]]</span>
    <li><a id="3.G"></a>Legal position: A position established by a <span class="tooltip" title="The defensive player within ten feet of the thrower's pivot or of the thrower if no pivot has been established. If the disc is not in a player's possession, a defensive player within ten feet of a spot on the field where the disc is to be put into play is considered the marker.">marker</span> that does not violate any of the provisions outlined in <a href="#15.B">15.B</a>. <span class="annotation">[[This refers to legal marking position.

    <li><a id="3.H"></a>Line: A boundary defining the playing areas. On an unlined field, the boundary is an imaginary line segment between two field markers with the thickness of said markers. Line segments are not extrapolated beyond the defining markers.
    <li><a id="3.I"></a>Pivot: The particular part of the body in continuous contact with a single spot on the field during a thrower's possession once the thrower has come to a stop or has attempted a throw or fake. When there is a definitive spot for putting the disc into play, the part of the body in contact with that spot is the pivot. <span class="annotation">[[This is not a body part, but rather an infinitesimally small point on the body.]]</span>
    <li><a id="3.J"></a>Possession of the disc: Sustained contact with, and control of, a non-spinning disc.
    <ol>
        <li><a id="3.J.1"></a>Catching a pass is equivalent to establishing possession of that pass.
        <li><a id="3.J.2"></a>Loss of possession due to <span class="tooltip" title="All player contact with the ground directly related to a specific event or maneuver (e.g., jumping, diving, leaning or falling), including landing or recovering after being off-balance. Items on the ground are considered part of the ground.">ground contact</span> related to a catch negates that player's possession up to that point. <span class="annotation">[[If the disc touches the ground while in a player's possession and the player subsequently loses possession due to ground contact, the earlier possession is negated and the previous contact of the disc with the ground results in a turnover.]]</span>
        <li><a id="3.J.3"></a>A disc in a player's possession is considered part of that player. <span class="annotation">[[Thus, hitting the disc in a player's possession is a foul]]</span>
        <li><a id="3.J.4"></a>The team whose player is in possession, or whose players may pick up the disc, is considered the team in possession. If the disc is in the air following a legal pass, the thrower's team is considered the team in possession.
    </ol>
    <li><a id="3.K"></a>Pull: The throw from one team to the other that starts play at the beginning of a half or after a goal. It is not a legal pass for scoring and has many special provisions (Section <a href="#9.B">9.B</a>). The player on the pulling team who possesses the disc and signals readiness is the puller. <span class="annotation">[[The pulling team may designate a new puller at any time before the pull.]]</span>
    <li><a id="3.L"></a>Scoring attempt: A scoring attempt starts at the beginning of the game or when the previous goal is scored and ends when the next goal is scored.
    <li><a id="3.M"></a>State of the disc: The nature of play at a particular moment during the game. There are three states of the disc:
    <ol>
        <li><a id="3.M.1"></a>A disc is "in play" when players are allowed to move and play may proceed without the defense's acknowledgment. An in-bounds disc in the central zone is in play. The disc is subject to a turnover. If no player has <span class="tooltip" title="Sustained contact with, and control of, a non-spinning disc.">possession</span> of a disc in play, any <span class="tooltip" title="A player whose team is in possession of the disc.">offensive player</span> may become the thrower by taking <span class="tooltip" title="Sustained contact with, and control of, a non-spinning disc.">possession</span> of the disc (<a href="#14.A">14.A</a>). Once a player has <span class="tooltip" title="Sustained contact with, and control of, a non-spinning disc.">possession</span> of the disc, they must establish a pivot at the spot of the disc <a href="#14.A.2">14.A.2</a>) prior to attempting a pass (17.K).
        <li><a id="3.M.2"></a>A disc is "live" when players are allowed to move and the disc is subject to a turnover, but the thrower cannot make a legal pass (e.g., walking the disc to the spot where it is to be put into play). For a live disc to be put into play, the thrower must (1) establish a pivot at the appropriate spot on the field, and (2) touch the disc to the ground (<a href="#14.B">14.B</a>).
        <li><a id="3.M.3"></a>A disc is "dead" when play has stopped and can continue only with a check (see 9.D). The disc is not subject to a turnover. A dead disc may change states to either <span class="tooltip" title="A disc is live when players are allowed to move and the disc is subject to a turnover, but the thrower cannot make a legal pass (e.g., walking the disc to the spot where it is to be put into play).

An in-bounds disc in the central zone is in play. The disc is subject to a turnover. If no player has possession of a disc in play, any offensive player may become the thrower by taking possession of the disc (14.A). Once a player has possession of the disc, they must establish a pivot at the spot of the disc 14.A.2) prior to attempting a pass (17.K).">in play</span> after a check depending on the circumstances.
    </ol>
    <li><a id="3.N"></a>Stoppage of play: Any halting of play due to a call, discussion, or timeout that requires a check or self-check to restart play. The term play stops means a stoppage of play occurs. <span class="annotation">[[Play-halting calls include "foul," "violation," "pick," "stall," etc.]]</span>
    <li><a id="3.O"></a>Throw: A disc in flight following any throwing motion (including a fake) that results in the thrower losing contact with the disc. <span class="annotation">[[Generally, a non-spinning, falling disc is not "in flight" unless it is intentionally dropped.]]</span>
    <ol>
        <li><a id="3.O.1"></a>A pass is equivalent to a throw.
        <li><a id="3.O.2"></a>An intentionally dropped disc is considered a thrown disc.
        <li><a id="3.O.3"></a>The act of throwing is the motion that transfers momentum from the thrower to the disc in the direction of flight and results in a throw. Pivots and wind-ups are not part of the act of throwing.
        <li><a id="3.O.4"></a>A throw is only considered complete when an <span class="tooltip" title="A player whose team is in possession of the disc.">offensive player</span> gains <span class="tooltip" title="Sustained contact with, and control of, a non-spinning disc.">possession</span> that is not otherwise negated.
        <li><a id="3.O.5"></a>An <span class="tooltip" title="A player whose team is in possession of the disc.">offensive player</span> in <span class="tooltip" title="Sustained contact with, and control of, a non-spinning disc.">possession</span> of, or who has most recently possessed, the disc, is the thrower.
