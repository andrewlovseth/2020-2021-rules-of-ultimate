The perimeter lines are not part of the playing field.
    <li><a id="4.D"></a>The playing field also includes two (2) goal lines parallel to the backlines. The two (2) areas bounded by each backline, the sidelines, and the nearest goal line are the end zones.

    <li><a id="4.F"></a>The goal lines separate the central zone from the end zones and are part of the central zone.
    <li><a id="4.G"></a>Brick marks are located in the central zone a set distance from each goal line and midway between the sidelines. Reverse brick marks are located in each end zone midway between the goal line and backline and midway between the sidelines. A midfield mark is located midway between the goal lines and midway between the sidelines.
    <li><a id="4.H"></a>The corners of the central zone and the end zones are marked by brightly colored, flexible cones or pylons.
