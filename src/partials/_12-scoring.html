    <li><a id="12.B"></a>If after receiving a pass outside the end zone, a player comes to a stop contacting the end zone without a pivot on the central zone, that player must carry the disc back to, and put it into play at, the closest spot on the goal line.
    <li><a id="12.C"></a>If a player scores according to <a href="#12.A">12.A</a>, but then unknowingly throws another pass, a goal is awarded to that player, regardless of the outcome of the pass. However, if it is unclear if the player scored according to <a href="#12.A">12.A</a> (i.e., there is no agreement on the player who had <span class="tooltip" title="The most complete view available by a player that includes the relative positions of the disc, ground, players, and line markers involved in a play.

    <li><a id="12.D"></a>If a player catches the disc and believes a goal has been scored the player may call "goal" and play stops. <span class="annotation">[[Under 12.A, scoring a goal includes surviving all ground contact related to the catch. Thus, "goal" may not be called if the player did not maintain possession through all ground contact related to the catch, nor may "goal" be called prior to completion of all ground contact related to the catch.]]</span> Best practice is to announce "goal" and raise both hands vertically above the head. After a contested or retracted goal call, play must restart with a check and the call is deemed to have been made when the pass was caught. <span class="annotation">[[Accordingly, the stall count will resume at 1 (<a href="#15.5">15.5</a>, <a href="#15.5.a.5">15.5.a.5</a>).
