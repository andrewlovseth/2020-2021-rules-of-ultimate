    <li><a id="16.A"></a>A player may bobble the disc in order to gain control of it, but purposeful bobbling (including tipping, delaying, guiding, brushing or the like) to oneself in order to advance the disc in any direction from where it initially was contacted is considered traveling. <span class="annotation">[[Tipping, brushing, etc. to someone else is legal. It is legal to tip/brush your own throw. However, if after a tip/brush, one is the first player to touch the disc, then it is deemed a tip/brush to oneself and it is a travel.]]</span> <span class="annotation">[[Remember, you can bobble for the purpose of gaining control, so kicking the disc up to yourself to help catch it would be legal. But tipping the disc for the purpose of evading a defender would not be legal.]]</span>
    <li><a id="16.B"></a>After catching a pass, a player is required to come to a stop as quickly as possible and establish a pivot.
    <li><a id="16.C"></a>If a player catches the disc while running or jumping the player may release a pass without attempting to stop and without setting a pivot, provided that:

        <li><a id="16.C.2"></a>the pass is released before three additional points of contact with the ground are made after <span class="tooltip" title="Sustained contact with, and control of, a non-spinning disc.">possession</span> has been established.

    <li><a id="16.E"></a>If it is unclear whether a catch was made before the disc contacted the ground (grass is considered part of the ground), or whether a player's first point of <span class="tooltip" title="All player contact with the ground directly related to a specific event or maneuver (e.g., jumping, diving, leaning or falling), including landing or recovering after being off-balance.
