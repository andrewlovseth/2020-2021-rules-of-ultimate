<ol>
    <li><a id="10.A"></a>The entire playing field is in-bounds. The perimeter lines are not part of the playing field and are out-of-bounds.
    <li><a id="10.B"></a>The out-of-bounds area consists of the ground which is not in-bounds and everything in contact (direct or indirect) with it except for players. Any <span class="tooltip" title="Any person who is not a player or sideline player as defined in these rules.">non-players</span> other than <span class="tooltip" title="Observers are non-player game officials whose job is to support the players in implementing a safe, fair, and efficient game.

    <li><a id="10.C"></a>A player contacting the out-of-bounds area is out-of-bounds. A player who is not out-of-bounds is in-bounds. An airborne player retains in-bounds or out-of-bounds status until that player contacts the playing field or the out-of-bounds area. The following exceptions apply:
    <ol>
        <li><a id="10.C.1"></a>If momentum carries a player out-of-bounds after landing in-bounds with <span class="tooltip" title="Sustained contact with, and control of, a non-spinning disc.">possession</span> of an in-bounds disc, the player is considered in-bounds. For this exception to apply, that player's first point of <span class="tooltip" title="All player contact with the ground directly related to a specific event or maneuver (e.g., jumping, diving, leaning or falling), including landing or recovering after being off-balance. Items on the ground are considered part of the ground.">ground contact</span> with any area must be completely in-bounds. The disc is put into play at the spot on the perimeter line of the playing field where the player first went out-of-bounds (unless <a href="#11.A.2">11.A.2</a> applies). If the player traversed the end zone being attacked, <a href="#11.B">11.B</a> applies.
        <li><a id="10.C.2"></a>A pivoting thrower may contact an out-of-bounds area, provided that part of the pivot remains in contact with the playing field. <span class="annotation">[[In this case, the player and the disc are considered in-bounds.]]</span>
        <li><a id="10.C.3"></a>Contact between players does not confer the state of being in- or out-of-bounds from one to another.
    </ol>
    <li><a id="10.D"></a>A disc becomes in-bounds when it is put into play, or when play starts or restarts.
    <li><a id="10.E"></a>A disc becomes out-of-bounds when it first contacts the out-of-bounds area, contacts an out-of-bounds <span class="tooltip" title="A player whose team is in possession of the disc.">offensive player</span>, or is caught by an out-of-bounds <span class="tooltip" title="A player whose team is not in possession of the disc. A defensive player may not pick up a live disc or a disc in play or call for a pass from the thrower.">defensive player</span>.
    <li><a id="10.F"></a>The disc may fly outside a perimeter line and return to the playing field, and players may go out-of-bounds to make a play on the disc.
    <li><a id="10.G"></a>If an in-bounds defender gains <span class="tooltip" title="Sustained contact with, and control of, a non-spinning disc.">possession</span> while airborne and becomes out-of-bounds while still in <span class="tooltip" title="Sustained contact with, and control of, a non-spinning disc.">possession</span> of the disc, the play is treated as if the defender was out-of-bounds when <span class="tooltip" title="Sustained contact with, and control of, a non-spinning disc.">possession</span> was gained (10.E).
    <li><a id="10.H"></a>To continue play after the disc becomes out-of-bounds, a member of the team gaining possession of the disc must carry it to, and put it into play at, the spot on the central zone nearest to where the most recent of the following events occurred:
        <ol>
            <li><a id="10.H.1"></a>the disc completely crossed the perimeter line;
            <li><a id="10.H.2"></a>the disc contacted an in-bounds player;
            <li><a id="10.H.3"></a>the disc contacted a <span class="tooltip" title="A player whose team is not in possession of the disc. A defensive player may not pick up a live disc or a disc in play or call for a pass from the thrower.">defensive player</span>; or
            <li><a id="10.H.4"></a>the disc became out-of-bounds due to contact with the out-of-bounds area or a player while any part of the disc was inside the perimeter line.
        </ol>
        After establishing a pivot at the appropriate spot on the field, the thrower must touch the disc to the ground before putting it into play (<a href="#14.B">14.B</a>).
    
    <li><a id="10.I"></a>Events occurring after the disc becomes out-of-bounds do not affect where it is put into play.
